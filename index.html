            We are an entire team of music lovers. Beyond music though, we're particularly passionate about
            understanding and
            visualizing recommendation algorithms in order to understand how they work. Our motivation for this project
            brings these
            two passions together. Our project is involved in the area of recommendation systems and algorithms. We want
            to allow
            our users to be able to find song recommendations, as well as understand what makes the songs similar in
            order to make
            on the spot judgements to create a creative linking throughout the work.

            Our tool has two primary use cases for this domain area and problem: playlist development for hobbyists or
            producers and
            live DJing for hobbyist or professional DJs. Producers of playlists or albums need to create a track
            ordering that tells
            a story or creates a seamless flow. To do this, they need to understand the similarity between songs and
            what drives
            that similarity in order to create an effective ordering. Alternatively, the role of a DJ is to make these
            judgements on
            the fly. Without an AI tool or automation, the DJ needs to rely on his own awareness of song options and
            understanding
            of their dynamics from memory. With our visualization tool, a DJ would be able to link songs together over
            time, make
            snap judgement decisions on which song to choose next, and see what trajectory his performance has taken
            over time.

            The original dataset was collected from the Free Musical Archive ("FMA"). FMA offers free access to open
            licensed,
            original music by independent artists around the world. Our tool visualizes different song tracks and
            recommended
            songs based on similarity of different attributes like valence, tempo and danceability. We used Python to
            clean and
            prepare our data. In order to find the similarity between songs, we decided to use the Euclidean distance
            method via
            Scikit-Learn to obtain an adjacency matrix for all nodes/songs. We then found top 6 matches and converted
            the data
            to a json file.

                    The following are potential issues with our dataset. Data sampling might not be accurate for our population,
                    presenting biases as only independent artists who are willing to upload their music for free. As a result,
                    the bias
                    is that any music that is privatized will not be present. Some data quality issues are that some tracks do
                    not have
                    genres associated with them and there are multiple tracks with the same names. There are also some erroneous
                    lines
                    in the csv file that had to be removed. To correct this, we had to manually delete such rows from the csv
                    files.
                    Moreover, outliers in the data consist of six songs that are shorter than two seconds.
